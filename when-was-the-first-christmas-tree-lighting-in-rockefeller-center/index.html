<p>How to watch the 2021 Rockefeller Center Christmas tree lighting for free The 79-foot Norway spruce is in NYC ready to light up the holiday season with 50000 bulbs and 3 million Swarovski. The official Christmas tree lighting ceremony that continues to this day started in 1933 when a 40-ft-tall tree illuminated with 700 lights debuted outside the old RCA building. Little did these workers know that their Christmas tree would spur a new tradition.
