<p>Christmas in New York is a very special time in the city and arguably the most wonderful time of the year. The most famous ice rinks are the ones in Bryant Park the Rink at Rockefeller Center with the Christmas tree in the backdrop and of course the famous Wollman Rink in Central Park. As the nation heads into the Christmas season fears are mounting that massive inflation and ongoing supply chain issues will make this. I had never been to New York but my love of the holiday season finally inspired me to plan a trip. Yes the city can be crowded and chilly.</p>
