There are many nownow onenow they stop and there are none. The cliffs stand Gleaming and huge out on a tranquil shore. Christmas trees presents and holly wreaths The feeling of love like a warm embrace Family and friends surrounding you With Christmas joy in each precious face.</p>

<p>The hawk god Horus represents divine kingship which could link to the fact that it thinks it is king of everything. One heavy day I ran away from the grim face of society and the dizzying clamor of the city and directed my weary step to the spacious alley. The cliffs stand Gleaming and huge out on a tranquil shore. Free Verse The sea is silent to-day The tides are high the moon sparks Upon the curved stairs. There is also a juxtaposition in the fact that the eye of Horus represent health and the gods protection.</p>
