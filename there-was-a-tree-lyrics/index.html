<p>There Was A Tree by Music Bugs. Chorus There is a tree beyond the world In its ancient roots a song is curled Im the fool whose lifes been spent Between whats said and what is meant I didnt mean what went so wrong Some things I wish I didnt know Ive always lived inside my head And often utterly alone I will be a pillow for your head You can make me promises you cant keep And Ill believe each word youve said. And what I heard there in the dark Are the secrets I will never tell. Now on this tree. There was a tree there was a tree All in the wood all in the wood The prettiest tree the prettiest tree That you ever did see that you ever did see The tree in a hole and the hole in the ground And the green grass grows all around all around The green grass grows all around And on that tree and on that tree There was a limb there was a limb The prettiest limb the prettiest.</p>
