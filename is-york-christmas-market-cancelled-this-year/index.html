<p>The Christkindelmarkt which normally runs from early November to just before Christmas had previously included a ski chalet-styled bar and big wheel before the initial cancellation in 2020. The market is being canceled due to a stark rise in hospitalizations due to COVID-19 according to Lonely Planet. This year the market is called off but those seeking a royal Christmas and who can show proof of full vaccination or evidence of COVID recovery can still get tickets to tour the rooms of the festively decorated manse and its grounds.
