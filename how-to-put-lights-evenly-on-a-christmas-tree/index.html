<p>If you cant place a tree near a power outlet try using an extension cord with a power strip. Decorating a Christmas tree is a time-honored tradition in many households. One of my favorite things to do every Christmas season is driving or walking through neighborhoods and catching glimpses of festive Christmas trees in living room windows decked out in lights garlands and ornaments. This will also act as a safety and convenience feature as you can easily turn off Christmas tree lights once youve put them on the tree by using the onoff switch on the power strip.
