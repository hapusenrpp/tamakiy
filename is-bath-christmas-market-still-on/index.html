<p>Bath Xmas market utterly destroyed after being taken over by the council and reduced to just a fraction of the previous number of stalls not worth the petrol and time anymore and will not return in 2022 for the first time in 5 years. Festive Christmas food and drinks will be for sale in the centre of Bath. Despite the physical Bath Christmas Market not going ahead this year this doesnt mean our makers have shut up shop. The much-loved market which is one of the best in the UK will instead host an array of smaller safer events in line with social distancing regulations. Bath artisan market and the vintage carousel will now be the highlights of the festive celebrations and Christmas lights and decorations will still go ahead.</p>
