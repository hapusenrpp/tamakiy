New York in December lights up the famous Christmas Tree at Rockefeller Plaza in light on December 1st but that doesnt mean you cant experience this magical tree. As Abby Rockefeller had done with Nelson so Nelson did with Michael schooling him in art the way other boys were schooled in baseball taking him to art dealers on Saturday afternoons.
