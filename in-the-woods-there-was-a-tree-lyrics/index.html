It is an unsettled question where and when Pierpont originally composed the song that would become known as Jingle Bells. A plaque at 19 High Street in the center of Medford Square in Medford Massachusetts commemorates the birthplace of Jingle Bells and claims that Pierpont wrote the song there in 1850 at what was then the Simpson Tavern.
