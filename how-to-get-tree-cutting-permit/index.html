<p>This permit allows you to cut a Christmas tree within designated areas of the Lake Tahoe. Once home cut the bottom of the trunk off and place the freshly cut trunk in a bucket of water. It is at the discretion of the contractor or homeowner to file a public space permit. Carry your tree carefully. Dragging the tree will rub off needles and bark.</p>
