<p>A simple affair by the looks of it but the tradition of public Christmas tree displays actually began in Madison Square Park in 1912. On Tuesday December 4th from 330 pm. It all starts with the lighting of the worlds most famous Christmas tree at Rock Center and closes with the ball drop in the fleshpit of Times Square on New Years. Lined beside these lanterns are a few Christmas trees decorated in beautiful white and gold ornaments. The live experience kicks off on December 6 2016 with the Madison Square Park tree-lighting ceremony and visitors will have until December 18 2016 to join in the holiday spirit at Gingerbread Boulevard.</p>
