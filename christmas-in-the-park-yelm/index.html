<p>Christmas in the Park is a free community event including a parade hosted by the Yelm Area Chamber of Commerce in coordination with the City. The community of Yelm is celebrating the holidays in two main installments this year with the first one having already occurred on Friday Dec. 2 to illuminate the night with the citys annual Christmas Tree Lighting event. The community blessing and lighting of the Christmas Tree and Water Tower will begin at 430pm. Christmas in the Park would not be in its 31st year without the hard work of volunteers especially co-chairs Cecelia Jenkin and Denise Hendrickson.</p>
