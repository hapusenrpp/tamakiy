<p>From these we find that the 3800 mAh battery can power this strip for 13125 hours 42 32 the 6000 mAh battery can power this strip for 24375 hours 78 32 and the 20000 mAh battery can power this strip for 625 hours 240 32. Complicating matters further the LED driver chips themselves use a tiny bit of current even when the LEDs themselves are off Each chip needs about 2 mA extrafor a strand of 25 its using about 50 mA just in this idle state. Also do LED light strips burn out. So we power the LED strips with AA batteries inside a 8AA Battery Holder. At 12 volts the current is 4012 amps This is 333 amps.</p>

<p>LED strip is 2m long. Microdrop LED lights constructed on thin uncoated wire should last over 100 hours with a fresh set of 3 AA batteries or 2 round C-style batteries and standard LED battery light sets with thicker insulation and LED lenses should last about 18-24 hours on a set of 3 AA. In this way how long do LED lights last on batteries. At 12V and 96W the strips would consume 08A of current. To temporarily power off simply click on the power button on the battery pack.</p>
