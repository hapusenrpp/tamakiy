If someone has to dress up like Santa or you wont back a fund raise Then youre a fuck face If it has to be Christmas for you to be nice Youre a bastard If you think compassions just in fashion Youre a fucking nob If it has to be New Years for you to make a change for the better Youre a spineless fucking turd Youre a spineless fucking turd. A Baby Just Like You Lyrics. Christmas Song Lyrics. Afternoon with the blinds pulled down.</p>

<p>And everything I wish for will be. A very merry Christmas And a happy New Year Lets hope its a good one Without any fear And so this is Christmas For weak and for strong For rich and the poor ones The world is so wrong And so happy Christmas For black and for white For yellow and red ones Lets stop all the fight A very merry Christmas And a happy New Year Lets hope its a good one. It Must Be Christmas Lyrics. But this is Christmas yes Christmas my dear The time of year to be with the ones you love So wont you tell me youll never more roam Christmas and new Years will find you home Therell be no more sorrow no grief and pain And Ill be happy happy once again Oh therell be no more sorrow no grief and pain And Ill be happy Christmas once again. That this is the season of cheer.</p>
