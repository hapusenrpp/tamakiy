If you know in advance that you want to re-plant your living Christmas tree the only real option is to purchase a tree that still has a large proportion of its roots intact. Pull away some old compost from the roots and surface then repot with fresh stuff.</p>

<p>Delay purchase until just before Christmas. If you know in advance that you want to re-plant your living Christmas tree the only real option is to purchase a tree that still has a large proportion of its roots intact. Can you replant a Christmas tree with roots. Wrap the root ball in plastic or wet sphagnum moss. For best results try this with several stems since not all will successfully develop roots.</p>
