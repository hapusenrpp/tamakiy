The English language phrase Christmas tree is first recorded in 1835 and represents an importation from the German language. The dream image of a mature flowering tree can evoke the Tree of Knowledge and the Tree of Life at the heart of Eden or the cross on which Jesus was sacrificed which is also called a tree and is a symbol of redemption.</p>
