<p>The lyrics 6 AM day after Christmas I throw some clothes on in the dark really convey a feeling of loneliness and depression about whats about to ensue. 6 am day after Christmas I throw some clothes on in the dark The smell of cold Car seat is freezing The world is sleeping I am numb Because it was going to be the only time Bens girlfriends parents would be away they had to go to get the abortion the day after Christmas. And merry rest of the year. Santa passed out with some ice on his head. She is balled up on the couch.</p>

<p>Answer 1 of 2. The eighth day after Christmas Before they could suspect I bundled up the Eight maids-a-milking. She is balled up on the couch. Santa passed out with some ice on his head. Car seat is freezing.</p>

<p>The smell of cold. So Heres the lyrical break down. 6 am day after Christmas I throw some clothes on in the dark The smell of cold Car seat is freezing The world is sleeping I am numb Up the stairs to her apartment She is balled up on the couch Her mom and dad went down to Charlotte theyre not home to find us out And we drive Now that I have found someone Im feeling more alone Than I ever have before. Car seat is freezing. I throw some clothes on in the dark.</p>
