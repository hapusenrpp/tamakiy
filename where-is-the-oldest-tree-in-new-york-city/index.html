<p>The sic English elm Ulmus procera at the corner of Waverly Place and MacDougal Street acquired its reputation during the American Revolutionary War the site explains. It dates back to the late 18th Century. The Oldest Parks 1686-1811 On April 27 1686 Governor Thomas Dongan granted the Dongan Charter of the City of New York. What was once thought to be the oldest known fossilized trees in the world are now second in line. That explains the selection criteria that were used to select specimens for an unusual program that will produce genetic reproductions of some of the oldest and sturdiest trees in the five boroughs.</p>

<p>3rd Ave Upper East Side of Manhattan. My understanding is that one of the oldest if not the oldest trees in New York City is a white oak in front of 233 Arleigh Road in Douglaston in northeast Queens. Which is the oldest elm tree in New York City. What was once thought to be the oldest known fossilized trees in the world are now second in line. On one hand a Parks Department web link seems to imply that people were indeed hanged from the 110-foot tree estimated to be at least 300 years old.</p>
