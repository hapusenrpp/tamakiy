The reason for Christmas Day Stars we have seen Over deserts and oceans The darkness was deep But never hopeless Redemption came And His name is Jesus Sing all you people The Lord Almighty reigns Sing every creature of God Come bless His name For He is good for He is good He was born to conquer the grave Light of the world The reason for Christmas Day. Lyrics Are Aranged as sang by the Artist. Smith featuring Mandisa from Smiths third Christmas album Its a Wonderful Christmas 2007.</p>
