Just follow your eyes. Suddenly I stop But I know its too late Im lost in a forest All alone. Just follow your eyes. A Forest is a song performed by the band The Cure featured in the radio station Wave 103 in Grand Theft Auto.</p>

<p>Written byRobert SmithLaurence TolhurstSimon GallupMatthieu Hartley. Come closer and see See into the trees Find the girl While you can Come closer and see See into the dark Just follow your eyes follow your eyes I hear her voice Calling my name The sound is deep In the dark I hear her voice I start to run Into the trees Into. Come closer and see. Come closer and see see into the. See into the trees.</p>
