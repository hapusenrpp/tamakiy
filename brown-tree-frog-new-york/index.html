<p>The Spring Peeper is thought to be the most common tree frog in New York even though it is rarely spotted. This frog breeds in marshy bogs or ponds often along the margins of slow-moving mountain-meltwater streams. These arboreal amphibians spend the vast majority of their life in trees and tall bushes only coming to the ground to mate and lay eggs. The call is a single-pulsed chuck with an occasional rolling snore. The range of this frog is from southern New York to Northern Florida to the whole of Texas to southern Minnesota.</p>
