Also most cities have a recycling center where you can drop off your plastic glass scrap metal paper or old artificial Christmas trees. Since artificial Christmas trees usually count as general household waste and not yard waste they can be thrown out in front load dumpsters at most apartments.</p>

<p>Thrift stores may accept donations of artificial trees as well so they can resell them. Compost the Tree. If your Christmas tree is too big to cut and place inside the green bin simply place the tree curbside next to your green waste bin on collection day. Pine trees are full of nutrients that can help balance soil PH levels and add nutrients to your yard flower beds or garden. Trees should be completely disassembled.</p>
