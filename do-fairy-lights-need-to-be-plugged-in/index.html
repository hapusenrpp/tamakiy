Fairy Lights are not considered as much as a lighting application rather than a decoration element since they are not very bright compared to the String Lights. They can be hung from trees wrapped in pillars form. Just so Why are there 3 wires on LED Christmas lights.</p>

<p>Use the Christmas light repair tool available at Amazon as directed in the instructions. I have also found challenges when working with these light strands. Fairy string lights are a great way to add flair to any home. You can buy these string lights with either an electrical plug or battery powered. Because the wires are thin.</p>
