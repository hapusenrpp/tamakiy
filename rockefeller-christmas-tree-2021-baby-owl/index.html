<p>One Christmas a tiny owl stuck in the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree stole the hearts of the nation. There once was an owl who lived in a tree. This years tree is a Norway spruce that will be displayed outside the Rockefeller Center. The Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree arrived in New York City on Saturday November 14. The little 20-centimeter-long 78-inch-long bird had traveled 170 miles inside the tree from her home in Oneonta where the tree was cut down.</p>

<p>A symbol of hope the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree inspired the childrens book The Carpenters Gift written by David Rubel and illustrated by Jim LaMarche in collaboration with Habitat for Humanity. On November 18 2020 numerous outlets reported that workers setting up the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree found and rescued a very tiny owl. An Adorable Baby Owl Hitchhiked to NYC in the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree. The petite saw-whet owl who was later nicknamed Rockefeller was discovered when the tree was being transported to Rockefeller Center in New York City after being cut down in Oneonta New York. The owl named Rockefeller was taken to a wildlife center for rehabilitation.</p>
