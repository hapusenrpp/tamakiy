<p>The young Saw-whet owl was found stuck in the branches of a towering Norway spruce grown in upstate New York and cut as Rockefeller Centers holiday tree last. The tree will be up until January 16 2022 according to a press release. From upstate New York to the Big Apple Rocky the owl stowed away on the 2020 Rockefeller Christmas tree and now its journey has been. This year the hallmark of the holiday season will travel to the Empire State by way of Maryland marking the first time a tree from that state has ever been used in Rockefeller Center. A petite saw-whet owl was found in the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree last year after apparently getting caught in the 75-foot Norway spruce when it was cut down in Oneonta NY last year.</p>
