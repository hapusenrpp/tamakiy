<p>The winter takeover of MINILAND happens every weekend in December. Everyone in my family has a ceramic Christmas tree all made by various members of my family. The first Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center probably looked more like Charlie Browns than the resplendent one today. If you make homemade gifts for your kids grandkids daycare kids or students at Christmas you will love this collection of 70 terrific homemade toys that you can make and give. This tree is made from sheets of birch plywood with stars cut out for modern Christmas tree alternatives.</p>
