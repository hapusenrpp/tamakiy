<p>Each year we put up a Christmas tree and this is because evergreen fir trees have been used to celebrate winter festivals for thousands of years. Thirdly some people use Xmas just so they do not offend non-Christians. In England they still use Happy Christmas. If you know the Greek meaning of X Xmas and Christmas essentially mean the same thing. This tradition of abbreviating Christ using the chi rho monogram continued throughout the centuries and also took shape as just the chi X as a way to save space.</p>

<p>Early use of Xmas includes Bernard Wards History of St. The second letter of these five letter is X or Christos. I know its unpopular to say in this world even offensive to most but the Bible says these customs and traditions of men are an abomination in Gods eyesunwitting sun god worship. Because this Victorian era Christmas traditions defined the way we celebrate Christmas even today we use merry instead of happy Christmas. There is a common misconception that the word Xmas stems from a secular attempt to remove the religious tradition from Christmas by taking the Christ out of Christmas but its use dates back to the 16th century.</p>

<p>Regardless of intent replacing Christ in the word Christmas is indeed removing or replacing Christ name from Christmas. In the early days of the Christian church Christians used the letter X as a secret symbol to indicate their membership in the church to others. Its no wonder that now when we hear Merry Christmas we hear something sentimental. My given name at birth was Robert Charles although before I was even taken home from the hospital my parents call. For us as Christians Christmas is one of the most holy of the holidays the birth of our savior Jesus Christ.</p>
