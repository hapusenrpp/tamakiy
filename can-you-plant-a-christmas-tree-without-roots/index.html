<p>Soak the roots in water before potting the tree in moist earth. But once the holidays are over youre left with a needle-shedding dead plant to toss out.

Once new roots have formed you can water it less frequently but do not spray or mist it. Typically the root ball will come covered by a piece of burlap.</p>
