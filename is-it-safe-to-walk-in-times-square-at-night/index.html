A nighttime walk around Time Square - the most popular and busiest attraction in New York. What about in Manhattan is it safe to walk in Manhattan at night. New York is very safe and at that time of night it is very busy.</p>

<p>Hi Shawn As other have indicated yes its safe but for a few things. The first is how you define night Is it 7PM. Take care around the Loop at night Though safe in the day. The downside of all the people for people watching. Common sense should prevail.</p>
