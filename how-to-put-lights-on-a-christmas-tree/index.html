<p>A Christmas Story. The lights of the tree are illuminated after the prayer of blessing. According to custom the Christmas tree is set up just before Christmas and may remain in place until the Solemnity of Epiphany. In the 1940s a young boy named Ralphie attempts to convince his parents his teacher and Santa that a Red Ryder BB gun really is the perfect Christmas gift. Its a beautiful full tree yet I was able to put ornaments inside and out.</p>

<p>Directed by Bob Clark. Its a beautiful full tree yet I was able to put ornaments inside and out. Horizontal is the most traditional way to install your Christmas tree lightstraveling around and around the tree to wind in the lights. 4x4 piece of pressboard plywood or MDF as a base. It was so nice not to have to put lights on the tree.</p>
