<p>Is New York Central Park Dangerous at night. Its possible to witness a Central Park crime as there would be more people in concentration. The Parks Department staffs Central Park with rangers mounted rangers and Parks Enforcement Patrol PEP officers as well as its own NYPD Precinct. Not at all anymore. Keep in mind however that most of the crimes that do happen in Central Park happen at night.</p>
