Place gravel in the bottom of the pot and fill it partially with regular potting soil before setting the tree in place. For a successful transplant it is ideal that youve kept the tree inside for no more than 10 days away from heat sources such as fireplaces or radiators and youve provided enough moisture to the earth ball.</p>

<p>Though not common it is possible for your cut natural Christmas tree to experience some new growth even though it is sitting in your home and is no longer connected to its root system. You can also buy a young seedling at a tree nursery. This is an expensive alternative but with proper care the tree will beautify the landscape for many years. A stem cutting from a shrub or tree can be used to start a new plant. Place gravel in the bottom of the pot and fill it partially with regular potting soil before setting the tree in place.</p>
