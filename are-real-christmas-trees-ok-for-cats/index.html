<p>The short answer is Yes. Since you know that Christmas trees are toxic to cats it might be best to use a fake tree to avoid the risk of illness. While it might appear to be near impossible to keep your cat especially younger kitties out of your Christmas tree it is possible to alleviate the issues that might come with a curious climbing kitty. Although your cat is unlikely to ingest a lot of tree many cats are tempted to nibble on Christmas tree branches and pine needles While. Christmas trees are most always pine fir or juniper which are all OK.</p>

<p>Cat behaviorist Pam Johnson-Bennett offers several ways to keep cats and Christmas trees safe this holiday season. As a cat person who has had everything from fake to real trees Id like to shed some light on the subject and give you some ideas as to what to expect and how to handle your cats being around fake Christmas trees. The form can vary by what kind of cats we have and also by how flexible we can make our definition of tree. But if someone happens to use yew that is a plant thats toxic to cats. Many of the reasons why a cat is drawn to a Christmas tree is also why a Christmas tree can be dangerous for them.</p>
