<p>Youll start with the end of the ribbon and just tuck it into the tree. It arrived at my front door December 23. Fluffing the tree was time consuming. This beautiful tree topper with sequin beaded detail adds just the right amount of glitz and glam to any look whether your style is more rustic modern or traditional. Try keeping the original clear acetate box packaging for storing in a cool dry area once the holidays are over.</p>
