The only time that the high temperature failed to reach zero was in 1983 when the high was only 1 below. Then last year it was in the 40s most of the day on Christmas eve then it started to snow pretty. A white Christmas is defined as having 1 inch or more of snow on the ground Christmas morning. The past two Christmas when we were in Rochester it was 65 degrees the second warmest Christmas there ever after 1973 when it was 68 and ALL the snow melted.</p>

<p>The lowest temperature of 26 below was observed in 1975. The last time there was snow on the ground on Christmas Day in. One of Duluths snowiest Christmases occurred in 2009 when 125 inches of the white stuff blanketed the city. Forecasts use the latest GFS and CFS model and updated every single day right up until Christmas. Although it didnt actively snow on Christmas Day in 2009 thats the last time New York City saw a white Christmas.</p>
