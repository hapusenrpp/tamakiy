<p>Bought this tree after wanting one for two years as price was the issue but last year the top half of my tree stopped working so decided to go with this tree I have been blowaway. Classic and beautiful icicle lights are a popular choice for Christmas and holiday lighting. The only I didnt like was the way the company labeled the 75ft tree as warm lights unlit. This tree is beautiful and looks just like the image. I didnt think it was pre lit so I ordered the 65 ft one instead.</p>

<p>The only I didnt like was the way the company labeled the 75ft tree as warm lights unlit. Its easy to put up nice looking fake tree without lights on but then you turn it on its a light show thats fantastic. This tree is beautiful and looks just like the image. You have to shape it at first like an other artificial tree. Its nice quality and I would reccomed to friends.</p>
