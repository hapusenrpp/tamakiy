<p>The saying that someone cant see the forest for the trees means that he is so involved with the details of a situation that he loses sight of the larger issue. Answer 1 of 4. This expression was already a proverb in John Heywoods 1546 collection. You-cant-see-the-forest-for-the-trees means that we sometimes cannot see situations as they really are while we are in the midst of them. As with most things this personality trait can be positive or negative depending on how you act on it.</p>
