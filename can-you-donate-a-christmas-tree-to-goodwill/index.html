Some of you might opt for a fragrant real tree and some might have a fake tree that is in need of a new home. Donate your artificial tree. Each tree donated will in turn be available for purchase at area Goodwill stores and the funds from selling donated trees and items will provide training and job opportunities for people within the community.</p>
