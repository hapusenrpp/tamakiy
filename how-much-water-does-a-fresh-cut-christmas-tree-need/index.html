Fill the tree stand with water and keep it filled. Keep the water at that mark through the season. Water the new tree until water uptake stops and continue to maintain the level of the stands full mark.</p>

<p>Trees are thirsty and can absorb a gallon of water a day so look for a stand that holds 1 to 15 gallons. 2 Do not cut any of the bark off to make it fit the stand. Cut trees will soak up as much H 2 O water they can get so no need to worry about fiddling with the water temperature. Sap on the trunk blocks water absorption and makes it difficult to maintain a fresh green Christmas tree full of robust healthy needles. When a Christmas tree is cut more than half its weight is water.</p>
