<p>Simply tie a big bow in your favorite wire-edged ribbon then by threading green florists wire through the back side of the bows knot secure the bow to the top branch. Theres no need to go out and buy an expensive tree topper. Leave the ends extra long for a more dramatic tree topper. I absolutely love the Holidays and your Christmas Tree is always the perfect way to help get you in the holiday spirit. Youll start with the end of the ribbon and just tuck it into the tree.</p>
