This weeklong Christmas read aloud for The Biggest Christmas Tree Ever focuses on comparing and contrasting characters and stories. Read aloud the story The Littlest Christmas Tree which introduces the lyrics to the historic song Oh Christmas Tree Building from the lyrics to the song summarize with students some of the history of the Christmas tree information found in the Background Agricultural Connections section of the lesson.
