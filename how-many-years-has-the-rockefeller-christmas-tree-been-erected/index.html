<p>1 day agoThe citys many holiday trees each offer a unique take on the tradition which began in NYC in 1912 when the first public Christmas tree was erected in. Edinburgh Christmas market has a couple of attractions eg. In many countries Christmas lights as well as other Christmas decorations are traditionally erected on or around the first day of Advent. Tomorrow it will light up New York City. Julie Price has turned many of the Norway spruce cones that fell from the 79-footer in her Elkton area back yard into commemorative Christmas.</p>
