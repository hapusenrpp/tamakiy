<p>Local authorities often arrange drop-off points or special collections of real trees in early January and advertise the dates this will take place with any other changes to collections over the Christmas period. A blog post on Tree Classics an artificial Christmas tree manufacturer suggests cutting the best limbs off an artificial Christmas tree and using them. National charities like the Goodwill and the Salvation Army will usually take an artificial tree that is in good. If thats the case chances are you also might not know that you can buy them at our retail stores and training centers as well. To date the Christmas Tree Project has given away thousands of trees and has become the largest Christmas Tree give-away organization in the world.</p>
